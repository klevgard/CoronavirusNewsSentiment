# CoronavirusNewsSentiment
This is a class assignment from the University of North Carolina, STOR320 taught by Mario Giacomazzo in the Summer of 2020.
We will be using publicly available data from multiple news websites (both national and local) along with coronavirus data to determine how public reaction may be skewed by media.

The news websites I chose were Fox (national), MSNBC, New York Times, Miami Herald, Sun Sentinel, Miami ABC7 WSVN, Fox 11 Los Angeles, LA Times, and LA Daily News.
