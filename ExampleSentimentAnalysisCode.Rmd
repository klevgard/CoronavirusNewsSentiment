This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Here we would just replace *fox.final* with any dataset we want. The two latter chunks add sentiment analysis to the dataset and also give a general "score" of how positive or negative the title and tagline are (either -1, 0, or 1).
```{r}
sentiment <- analyzeSentiment(fox.final$Title)
sentiment2 <- analyzeSentiment(fox.final$Tagline)
score <- convertToDirection(sentiment$SentimentQDAP)
score2 <- convertToDirection(sentiment2$SentimentQDAP)
```

```{r}
fox.final$sentiment <- sentiment
fox.final$sentiment2 <- sentiment2
fox.final$SS <- NA
fox.final$SS <- ifelse(score == 'positive', 1, fox.final$SS)
fox.final$SS <- ifelse(score == 'negative', -1, fox.final$SS)
fox.final$SS <- ifelse(score == 'neutral', 0, fox.final$SS)
```

```{r}
fox.final$SS2 <- NA
fox.final$SS2 <- ifelse(score2 == 'positive', 1, fox.final$SS2)
fox.final$SS2 <- ifelse(score2 == 'negative', -1, fox.final$SS2)
fox.final$SS2 <- ifelse(score2 == 'neutral', 0, fox.final$SS2)
head(fox.final)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
